tls-endpoint-data
=================

This folder contains files that are used to merge with the
openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environment/ssl/* environment files to
create an EndpointMap value that includes our ExampleService.

Files in this folder should not be used for a deployment, but should be used
when needing to create a tls enabled environment file that defines a new
EndpointMap value for the deployment.

- DONE: Network endpoint integration (EndpointMap, ServiceNetMap)
- Keystone resources (endpoints, users, etc)
- Database resources (MySQL DB, user, perms)
- Example of composable service with:
  * hosts prep tasks or deploy tasks just calling an Ansible role
  * config containers, calling Puppet to configure config files
  * startup containers, using kolla interface to start containers
  * all framework task types
- Role modification
- Package deployment methods
  * virt-customize overcloud-full
  * deployed-server rpm install with repos
- Bonus: rpm packaging
- Bonus: basic structure for a clean Ansible role (chrony as example?)
- Bonus: basic puppet module example (for use with container configs)
- Extra: Have endpoint map file generated at build time
